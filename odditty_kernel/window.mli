(* Translate key presses and other user events into actual bytes to send to the

 * more descriptive than strings, but this should do for now.

 * We could in theory also have some of clock tick function, to determine how
 * the terminal behaves when a key is held down. However, in practice I think
 * the terminal behavior is always:
 *  - emit a key press immediately on key down
 *  - emit more key presses if the key continues to be held down for a period
 * This could all be handled in the driver that calls [from_user].
