 - Tab is weird:
   * If we send `echo "\t"\n` in one go, then \a shows up on the line and in
     the output.
   * If we send `echo "\t` and `"\n` separately, then \a shows up on the line
     but not in the output.
   * On the line editor, a \t is turned into spaces and the number of spaces
     changes if you insert characters in front. However, if you, e.g. echo the
     \t, a \t is emitted.
