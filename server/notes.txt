 - Tab is weird:
   * If we send `echo "\t"\n` in one go, then \a shows up on the line and in
     the output.
   * If we send `echo "\t` and `"\n` separately, then \a shows up on the line
     but not in the output.
   * On the line editor, a \t is turned into spaces and the number of spaces
     changes if you insert characters in front. However, if you, e.g. echo the
     \t, a \t is emitted.

 - An interesting example command to run:
     ./main.native tty -term xterm -cwd /tmp -env TERM=xterm -exe /usr/bin/vim -- vim | tee /tmp/x
   I'm unsure why, but vim just continually outputs characters...

 - If you use vt100, it doesn't spew output constantly.

 - Weirdly, if you launch it with no environment, it doesn't do anything for a while (a few minutes?). This is weird b/c if I run vim in an actual terminal (with all environment variables removed) it runs fine. Maybe bash always reexports the 'term' variable
